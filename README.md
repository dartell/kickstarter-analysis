# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this report is to determine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  To determine this, two charts were created.  The first chart measured theater outcomes based on launch date.  The second measured outcomes based on goal

## Analysis and Challenges

Data used was from a kickstarter analysis spreadsheet.  In the first analysis, Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, I compared successful, failed, and canceled campaigns over a year.  In the second analysis, I compared the percentage of successful and failed kickstarters based on the goal.  In both of these reports, I used a line chart to show the change over time.  Potential challenge is in regards to the Outcomes Based on Goal chart.  It doesn't give context of how many campaigns are within the percentage.  For example, the 45000 to 49999 bin only has one campaign that failed, so it reads, "100% of campaigns between 45000 to 49999 have failed".  While true, the decision maker should know that only one kickstarter campaign in that bin was attempted.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Conclusion 1: Successful Theater campaigns are mostly succesfuly in May.  One could draw the conclusion that theater campaigns tend to be more popular during the spring time frame (Mar-May).  Popularity decreases during summer into fall.
Conclusion 2: Theater campaigns are rarely canceled.  This means that the campaign owner is usually committed to seeing their campaign succeed.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Conclusion 1:  Campaigns with goals of less than 1000, 1000 to 4999, 10000 to 14999, 35000 to 39999, and 40000 to 49999 tend to be more successful. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Conclusion 1: Successful Theater campaigns are mostly succesfuly in May.  One could draw the conclusion that theater campaigns tend to be more popular during the spring time frame (Mar-May).  Popularity decreases during summer into fall.
Conclusion 2: Theater campaigns are rarely canceled.  This means that the campaign owner is usually committed to seeing their campaign succeed.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Conclusion 1:  Campaigns with goals of less than 1000, 1000 to 4999, 10000 to 14999, 35000 to 39999, and 40000 to 49999 tend to be more successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Potential limitations is in regards to the Outcomes Based on Goal chart.  It doesn't give context of how many campaigns are within the percentage.  For example, the 45000 to 49999 bin only has one campaign that failed, so it reads, "100% of campaigns between 45000 to 49999 have failed".  While true, the decision maker should know that only one kickstarter campaign in that bin was attempted.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could use a histogram or even a box and whisker chart to find any outliers.
